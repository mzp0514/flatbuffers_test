# Environment
Operating System: MacOS 13.3.1

Compiler: Apple clang version 14.0.3 (clang-1403.0.22.14.1)

# Setup
Install necessary tools:
```
brew install cmake
brew install flatbuffers
```

Enter project root directory and execute:
```
flatc --cpp --gen-mutable -o ./include/ ./schema/property.fbs
flatc -b -o ./data/ --schema ./schema/property.fbs

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

Start receiver:
```
./receiver
```

Start sender:
```
./sender
```

# Solutions
The solution to the first three tasks: `schema/property.fbs`, `sender.cpp`, `receiver.cpp`

The solution to the last task:

If the property tree is updated frequently by the sender, we can let the receiver poll on the TCP socket or use message queue to receive updates.
